# Divergences from Go tailcat

tailcat.rs aims to interoperate with [Go tailcat](https://github.com/tailscale/tailcat)
and to behave the same way by default. This file lists the places where it
deliberately behaves differently, and why. Each entry says what Go does,
what tailcat.rs does, and whether the difference is visible to a Go peer.

Wire formats (addresses, key files, DERP, disco, WireGuard) don't diverge;
anything here is local behavior.
